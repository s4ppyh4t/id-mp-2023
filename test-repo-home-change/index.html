                    <p>Migration is a natural and inevitable aspect of human history.
                        In the current globalized world, international migration has 
                        become more common. In 2020 alone, according to the World Migration 
                        Report, there were 281 million international migrants, or 3.6 
                        percent of the world's population. There are both push factors 
                        and pull factors resulting in cross-border migration. On the former, 
                        internal displacement has been one of the key. Promising economic benefits 
                        and living conditions are high on the list for the pull factors.

                                <p>
                                According to the Global Report on Internal Displacement 2023, 
                                over 70 million people were living in internal displacement 
                                worldwide at the end of 2022, a 20 percentage increase in a year 
                                and the highest number ever recorded. Causes of internal displacement 
                                include both natural disasters and socio-economic and political crises. 
                                Common among the natural disasters are flood, drought, wildfire, earthquake, 
                                and volcanic eruption. Zooming on the case of Australia, wildfire has by far
                                been recorded as the number one case of displacement, followed by storm and earth quake.

                                <p>People from other continents have migrated to Australia. 
                                    The World Migration Report 20202 from IOM indicates that the country
                                    is of the 10 top destinations for international migration. 
                                    According to the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 
                                    in the year ending 30 June 2022, overseas migration contributed a net 
                                    gain of 171,000 to Australia's population. This represents a very large 
                                    increase in net overseas migration on the 2020-21 financial year.</p>
